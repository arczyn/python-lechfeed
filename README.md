# python-lechfeed
Script that creates custom RSS feed from Lech Poznan's official website

It's one of my first Python scripts, written in April 2020. The official website of Lech Pozna≈Ñ doesn't provide any RSS feed, but I wanted to have it on my personal RSS reader. I run it on my private Synology NAS with a schedule. Script runs three times a day and keeps my updated with the news about my favourite football team.

Most important libraries used:
- request to connect
- BeautifulSoup to scrap
- re to remove problematic characters with regex
